## 📊 Data Flow

```
Client Request
    ↓
[WebSocket] → SDK Server → Validates simulator connection
    ↓
Forwards to AviaConnector (C++)
    ↓
C++ queries MSFS SimConnect API
    ↓
Receives airport/runway data
    ↓
Converts to JSON
    ↓
[WebSocket] → SDK Server → Parses as NearestAirportData
    ↓
Triggers "NearestAirportData" event
    ↓
Application handles event
```

## 🔌 Integration Points

### C++ ↔ SDK Communication

The SDK interfaces with the C++ AviaConnector through WebSocket messages:

**Request Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "request",
  "data": { "type": "NearestAirportData" },
  "ts": 1696262400000
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "NearestAirportData",
  "ts": 1696262400000,
  "data": {
    "airport": { /* Airport data */ },
    "distanceNM": 5.2,
    "bearing": 287.5,
    "aircraftPosition": { /* Position data */ }
  }
}
```

### Type Matching

TypeScript interfaces match C++ structures exactly:

| C++ Structure | TypeScript Interface |
|--------------|---------------------|
| `NearestAirportData` | `NearestAirportData` |
| `Airport` | `Airport` |
| `Runway` | `Runway` |
| `RunwayEnd` | `RunwayEnd` |
| `AircraftDataStruct` (subset) | `AircraftPosition` |

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start SDK Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:airport
   ```

2. **Launch MSFS:**
   - Open Microsoft Flight Simulator
   - Load any aircraft at any location
   - Ensure flight is fully loaded

3. **Connect AviaConnector:**
   - Launch AviaConnector desktop app
   - Configure to connect to `ws://localhost:8080`
   - Click "Connect"

4. **Verify Data Flow:**
   - Server should log "Simulator connected: MSFS"
   - After 2 seconds, nearest airport data should appear
   - Verify runway information is complete

5. **Test Client:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:client
   ```
   - Press `a` to request aircraft data
   - Press `n` to request nearest airport data
   - Press `q` to quit

### Expected Output

Server should display:
```
🚀 AviaConnector SDK Server listening on ws://0.0.0.0:8080
✅ Simulator connected: MSFS
📡 Auto-requesting nearest airport data...
